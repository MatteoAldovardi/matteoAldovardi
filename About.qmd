Hey there, I'm Matteo Aldovardi, and I have a passion for math. I studied mathematics at the University of Pisa.

I graduated on October 28th with a thesis in Harmonic Analysis. If you're curious, you can find it in the University's archive:

I also collaborated with my thesis advisor on an article based on my thesis work. It focuses on a refined version of the Hardy Fractional Inequality. You can read it here:

These days, I'm following Jeremy Howard's fastai course. As part of my coursework, I worked on a neural net project (resnet18), which was trained on the dataset available on the website Mendeley Data - Crack Detection. Here is the link to my finished project on hugginface.

    "text": "Hey there, I’m Matteo Aldovardi, and I’m pretty passionate about math. I studied mathematics at the University of Pisa.\nI graduated on October 28th 2022 with a thesis in Harmonic Analysis. If you’re curious, you can find it in the University’s archive here:\nhttps://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-10012022-110009/\nI also teamed up with my thesis advisor to write an article based on my thesis work. It’s a new result, a slightly refined version of the Hardy Fractional Inequality, and you can give it a read here:\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40574-023-00359-7#article-info\nAs of October 2023, I’m following Jeremy Howard’s fastai course. As part of my coursework, I’ve created a web app over at huggingface.co. This app can tell you if surfaces are cracked or intact using a neural network called resnet18. I trained this neural net using the dataset available at this website:\nhttps://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5y9wdsg2zt/2\nIf you’d like to see my project in action, you can check it out here:\nhttps://huggingface.co/spaces/MatteoAld/Muri"

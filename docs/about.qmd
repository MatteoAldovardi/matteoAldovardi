Hey there, I'm Matteo Aldovardi, and I'm pretty passionate about math. I studied mathematics at the University of Pisa. 

I graduated on October 28th 2022 with a thesis in Harmonic Analysis. If you're curious, you can find it in the University's archive here:

I also teamed up with my thesis advisor to write an article based on my thesis work. It's a new result, a slightly refined version of the Hardy Fractional Inequality, and you can give it a read here:

As of October 2023, I'm following Jeremy Howard's fastai course. As part of my coursework, I've developed a web app on huggingface.co. This app can tell you if surfaces are cracked or intact using a neural network called resnet18. I trained this neural net using the dataset available at this website:
